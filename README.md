Dims household lights and other resistive loads.
  
* CAUTION: Do not use on flourescent lights or inductive loads! Verify your device can handle dimming before using.
  
Fires up to four triacs a certain time after detecting the zero cross time of the mains line AC voltage.  The fire delay time is set by a potentiometer for each triac.
